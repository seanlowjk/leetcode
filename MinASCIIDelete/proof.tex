\section*{Preface}

Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

\section*{Theorem} 

Let $f(i, j)$ denote the function of the lowest ASCII sum given indexes $i, j$ where $i$ is the index of the first string and $j$ is the index of the second string. Let us denote the strings to be $s_1[1...N] \land s_2[1...M]$

\[
    f(i, j) =
    \left \{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      0 & \textbf{if } i = N \land n = M \\
      \sum ASCII(s_2[j...M]) & \textbf{if } i = N \\ 
      \sum ASCII(s_1[i...N]) & \textbf{if } j = M \\ 
	  min( ASCII(s_1[i]) + f(i+1, j),  ASCII(s_2[j]) + f(i, j+1) ) & \textbf{otherwise} 
    \end{array}
     \right \} 
\]

\section*{Proof of Correctness} 

\begin{enumerate}

\item We can reduce the $MinASCIIDiff$ problem into the $LCS$ problem, aka the \textbf{Longest Common Subsequence Problem} 

\item The reduction is trivial as this problem aim to remove the different characters to get the longest common subsequence 

\item As a result, proving the correctness of the $MinASCIIDiff$ problem is \textbf{equivalent} to proving the correctness of the $LCS$ problem

\end{enumerate}
